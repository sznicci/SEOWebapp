# SEO Statistics Webapp

This application is a tool for measuring SEO efforts. (I did not maintain it since 2012 and it is currently broken, I will fix it soon.)

## Measurements

This part of the program uses the Google Custom Search API to query and log the ranking of the given webpages periodically.
(See measurements directory.)

## Web UI

This is the web based user interface that allows user maintenance and displaying the statistics. This component uses JSP technology.
(See SEOwebapp directory.)
